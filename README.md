ðŸ”­ **What I'm Currently Up To:**

- ðŸ“š Continuing my journey through university, where I'm polishing my skills in C++ as part of my coursework.
- ðŸŒ± Diving deeper into web development, with a focus on JavaScript for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.



ðŸ’» **My Skills:**
- Programming Languages: C++, JavaScript
- Front-End Development: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (with a keen eye for responsive and user-friendly design)
- Back-End Development: Currently expanding my knowledge to build strong server-side applications

ðŸš€ **My Journey:**

Throughout my first year at university, I developed a solid foundation in programming, particularly C++, which enhanced my problem-solving abilities. Alongside my coursework, I discovered a deep interest in web development, an area that continues to thrive and is in high demand. I have since polished my skills in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript etc allowing me to create intuitive and visually appealing web interfaces.

My current focus is on back-end development, where I am learning to build robust, secure, and scalable server-side applications. My goal is to gain hands-on experience with essential technologies and tools, so I can understand and implement full-stack solutions effectively.
