- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently expanding my expertise in web development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on mastering JavaScript for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

After honing my front-end skills, I will be transitioning into backend development. My goal is to understand and implement robust, secure, and scalable server-side solutions by exploring the key technologies and tools involved.
